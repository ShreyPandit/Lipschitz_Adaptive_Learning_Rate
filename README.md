# Lipschitz Adaptive Learning Rate
<br>
This is an implemetation of paper by:- <br>
Yedida, Rahul, and Snehanshu Saha. "A novel adaptive learning rate scheduler for deep neural networks." arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.07399 (2019).
<br>
Using keras and Tensorflow . Main function is lr_scheduler which uses the callback of LRScheduler. All the code can be found in this repository . <br>
The summary sheet is made which contains the result for all of the datasets.<br>
The datasets on which this LALR is implemented are:-<br>
<li>
  1) MNIST <br>
  2) IRIS <br>
  3) Boston Housing data <br>
  4) CIFAR-10 <br>
  5) CIFAR-100 <br>
</li>
